# Livecode Server Tidbits
Livecode Server is a wonderful tool. I hope to bring you some practical examples of Livecode Server in action. This book looks at the ways I've use Livecode Server for projects.

Some background. I am not an Author. I have never written a book before. I am not an Expert at Livecode. I was (am) frustrated at the lack of tutorials and examples for Livecode Server.

Please, be kind. I may not do things as the Pros would. But that is another reason I'm putting together these Tidbits. My hope is that I'll get feedback and also learn how to properly implement Livecode Server solutions.

This book's Chapters bring together similar topics. The book is dynamic and ever changing. As you would a Blog or Tutorial web site, you should check back often as sections change and modified.

Why Git Books? Well, to be honest, I wanted to learn how to use the tool for potential use in other projects. Worse case I have all the content in Markdown format and can move it to a different method of delivery if I need to.

So enjoy and let's see where we end up with my first book. Welcome to Livecode Server Tidbits!
